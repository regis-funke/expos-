# Data Science Coursework Projects Directory

This directory contains two comprehensive projects that are part of a data science coursework. Each project addresses distinct aspects of machine learning and data analysis using Python and various libraries. Below is a brief overview of each project.

## Project 1: Perceptron and SMOTE Analysis

### Overview
This project delves into the implementation and analysis of a Perceptron model and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). It includes exercises ranging from basic Perceptron operations to advanced techniques for handling imbalanced datasets.

### Key Aspects
- Basic Perceptron implementation and testing.
- Tensor modeling for data tagging.
- In-depth analysis of SMOTE's effectiveness in imbalanced datasets.
- Comparisons of Perceptron performance with various data sampling methods.
- Detailed discussions on the outcomes and implications of the different techniques used.

### Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly Express, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn

## Project 2: Neural Network-Based Credit Default Prediction

### Overview
This project extends prior work on analyzing anonymized bank customer data by developing a neural network model to predict credit defaults. It aims to enhance the accuracy of default predictions through advanced neural network techniques.

### Key Aspects
- Data ingestion and preprocessing from the South German Credit dataset.
- Correlation analysis and visualization of credit-related variables.
- Development and tuning of a flexible multilayer perceptron model in PyTorch.
- Handling class imbalances and evaluating model performance.
- Insightful comparisons between neural network performance and traditional machine learning models.

### Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly Express, PyTorch, ray.tune
