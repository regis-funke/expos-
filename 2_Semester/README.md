# Data Science Coursework: Projects Overview

This directory contains two comprehensive data science projects focusing on different aspects of text analysis and political communication analysis. Both projects are part of a data science coursework, demonstrating the application of various data science techniques and Python libraries.

## Project 1: Text Analysis and Word Embedments

### Overview
A multifaceted project delving into text data analysis, web scraping, word cloud generation, training word embeddings, and building a content-based recommender system. 

### Key Aspects
- **Web Scraping**: Automated extraction of articles from a news website.
- **Word Cloud Generation**: Creating visual representations of text data.
- **Training Word Embeddings**: Utilizing Word2Vec and FastText for model training.
- **Content-based Recommender System**: Recommending articles based on word embeddings.

## Project 2: Analysis of German Parliament Press Releases

### Overview
An analytical project aimed at examining the communications of the German parliament, extracting and analyzing prevalent topics over a specific timeframe.

### Key Aspects
- **Data Scraping**: Collecting press releases for text analysis.
- **Data Filtering**: Using LDA for filtering out specific types of press releases.
- **Topic Analysis**: Employing LDA for topic modeling and analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing topic trends and distributions over time.

## Technologies Used Across Projects
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Gensim, NLTK, Matplotlib, Plotly Express, pyLDAvis, Requests, Spacy, WordCloud.

## Usage
To replicate these analyses:
1. Install Python along with the required libraries.
2. Clone the respective repositories for each project.
3. Execute the provided Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks as per project requirements.

## Licensing
Both projects are open-source, intended for educational and research purposes under standard open-source licenses.

### Note
