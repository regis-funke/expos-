# Data Sciences Coursework Project: K-Means Clustering Analysis

## Overview

This project is part of a data sciences coursework, focusing on the application of K-Means clustering to various datasets. The project is structured into several exercises, each addressing different aspects of clustering and data analysis.

## Content and Methods

### Exercise 1: Initial Data Analysis
- **Dataset A Analysis**: Initial exploration of Dataset A, including the number of instances and features, feature range, and standard deviation.
- **Scatter Plot Visualization**: A scatter plot of Dataset A to visualize the data distribution.

### Exercise 2: K-Means Clustering on Dataset A
- **Silhouette Coefficient Analysis**: Computation of K-Means clusterings for `k` values ranging from 2 to 10, and analysis using silhouette coefficients.
- **Optimal Cluster Identification**: Identification of the optimal number of clusters based on silhouette coefficients.
- **Cluster Visualization**: Visualization of the clustering results using scatter plots and color coding for different clusters.

### Exercise 3: K-Means Clustering on Dataset B
- **Inertia Analysis**: Computation of K-Means clusterings for different `k` values and analysis of inertia.
- **Elbow Method Application**: Use of the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Silhouette Plot Comparison**: Comparison of the best `k` value using silhouette plots.
- **Cluster Distribution Analysis**: Analysis of feature distribution within each cluster.

### Exercise 4: Line Representations and Clustering on Dataset C
- **K-Means Clustering**: Application of K-Means clustering to Dataset C.
- **Line Representations**: Mathematical representation and visualization of lines in relation to the clustered data.
- **Cluster and Line Relationship Analysis**: Discussion on the relationship between the lines and the clustered dataset.
