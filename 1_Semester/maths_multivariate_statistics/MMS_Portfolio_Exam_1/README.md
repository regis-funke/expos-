# Data Science Coursework: Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of a Data Science coursework focusing on clustering analysis using k-Means algorithm. It involves conducting a series of exercises to analyze datasets with different characteristics, determine the optimal number of clusters (k), and explore the relationship between different features in the datasets.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into multiple exercises, each tackling a specific aspect of clustering analysis:

### Part I: Portfolio Exam
#### Exercise 1: Initial Analysis
- Ingest and analyze raw Dataset 𝐴.
- Determine the number of instances, features, feature range, and standard deviation.

#### Exercise 1.5: Data Visualization
- Visualize data using a scatter plot.

#### Exercise 2: k-Means Clustering
- Perform k-Means clustering on Dataset 𝐴 for k = 2, 3, ..., 10.
- Compute silhouette coefficients and plot against k.
- Choose optimal k and visualize clustering with scatter plot.

#### Exercise 2.4: Data Standardization
- Address issues with the dataset by standardizing the data.
- Reconduct clustering analysis post-standardization.

#### Exercise 3: Inertia Calculation
- Compute k-means clustering on raw Dataset 𝐵 for k = 2, 3, ..., 10.
- Calculate inertia and plot against k using the elbow method.

#### Exercise 3.4: Optimal k Determination
- Determine the best k using KneeLocator.
- Compare results with silhouette plot.

#### Exercise 3.6: Cluster Visualization
- Visualize clustering of Dataset 𝐵 using scatter plot and colors.

#### Exercise 3.8: Feature Distribution Analysis
- Analyze the distribution of each feature in each cluster.

### Part II: Line Representations
#### Exercise 4.1 to 4.4
- Perform k-Means clustering for Dataset 𝐶 with k = 2.
- Integrate mathematical line representations into cluster visualization.
- Discuss the relation of lines to clustered datasets.
