# Data Science Coursework Repository

This repository hosts two major projects from a Data Science coursework, focusing on Clustering Analysis and Weather Pattern Analysis. These projects showcase the application of various data science techniques including k-Means clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Clustering Analysis

- **Objective**: Conduct a comprehensive clustering analysis using the k-Means algorithm.
- **Key Activities**:
  - Analyze raw datasets to understand their characteristics.
  - Determine the optimal number of clusters using silhouette coefficients and the elbow method.
  - Visualize data and clustering results with scatter plots.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly Express, Scikit-learn, Kneed, Yellowbrick.
- **Installation**: Requires Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly Express, Scikit-learn, Kneed, and Yellowbrick libraries.
- **Contribution**: Contributions for enhancements are welcome.

### 2. Weather Pattern Analysis for Halle Tourist-Information

- **Objective**: Analyze local weather conditions in Halle using 2020 data from the Saaleaue weather station.
- **Key Activities**:
  - Data preparation including cleaning, reduction, resampling, and standardization.
  - Perform clustering analysis to identify characteristic weather patterns.
  - Interpretation of results to provide clothing recommendations for tourists.
- **Data Source**: [Saaleaue weather station](https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/wetter/).
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly Express, Numpy.
- **Installation**: Clone the repository and ensure the necessary Python libraries are installed.
- **Acknowledgements**: Thanks to the Halle Tourist-Information and the providers of the weather station data.

## General Information

- **License**: Both projects are open-source and available under standard open-source licenses.
- **Usage**: To replicate the analysis, clone the repository, install necessary Python libraries, and run the provided Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts.
