# Data Visualization and Analysis Projects

This repository hosts two distinct data visualization and analysis projects, each focusing on a unique aspect of data interpretation and presentation. Below is a brief overview of each project.

## 1. Visualization Challenge

### Overview
Created by Regis Funke, this project provides an in-depth analysis of the Happy Planet Index (HPI) using advanced data visualization techniques. It explores the relationships between various factors like GDP per capita, life expectancy, and ecological footprint, and their impact on the HPI.

### Key Highlights
- Correlation analysis between different variables and the HPI.
- Time series analysis of Zimbabwe's HPI from 2006 to 2020.
- Global visualization of HPI and comparative analysis across continents.

## 2. Data Visualization Project: Analyzing Inflation Trends

### Overview
This project, part of a data sciences coursework, analyzes and visualizes inflation trends based on data from DESTATIS (German Federal Office of Statistics). It includes a Python notebook for data preparation and an R Markdown document for data visualization and analysis.

### Key Highlights
- Data preparation involving fetching, cleaning, and transforming DESTATIS data.
- Historical analysis of inflation trends since 1991.
- Detailed analysis of price development in various consumer spending categories.
