# Data Science Coursework Projects

This repository contains two distinct projects completed as part of a data science coursework. Each project utilizes Python for data analysis, focusing on different datasets and methodologies.

## Project 1: Data Science Coursework - Clustering Analysis

### Overview
This project involves clustering analysis using the k-Means algorithm. It explores datasets with different characteristics to determine the optimal number of clusters and understand the relationships between various features.

### Key Components
- Initial data analysis and visualization.
- Performing k-Means clustering and determining the optimal number of clusters.
- Standardizing data and recalculating clusters.
- Inertia calculation and optimal k determination using the KneeLocator.
- Detailed cluster visualization and feature distribution analysis.

### Technologies
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly Express, Scikit-learn, Kneed, Yellowbrick.

## Project 2: Weather Pattern Analysis for Halle Tourist-Information

### Overview
Commissioned by the Halle Tourist-Information, this project analyzes local weather conditions using 2020 data from the Saaleaue weather station. The goal is to identify characteristic weather patterns for tourist clothing recommendations.

### Methodology
- Data preparation and cleaning, including standardization and resampling.
- Clustering analysis using KMeans, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering.
- Interpreting and visualizing characteristic weather patterns like sunny summer days, windy days, etc.

### Technologies
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly Express, Numpy.
