# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two major projects in the field of data science and machine learning. Each project focuses on a different application of machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Below is an overview of each project.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Data Science Project: Analysis of Online Shoppers' Purchasing Intention

This project aims to predict online shoppers' purchasing intentions using various machine learning algorithms. It involves a detailed analysis of the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention" dataset and applies techniques like k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest for predictive modeling.

#### Key Features:
- Application of k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest algorithms.
- Comprehensive data analysis and feature importance study.
- Evaluation of model performance and stability.

### 2. Credit Compliance Prediction Project

This project focuses on developing a statistical model to predict bank customers' credit compliance. It uses a dataset of 1000 anonymized bank customers and applies machine learning classifiers like KNN, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Classifier for prediction.

#### Key Features:
- Exploratory data analysis to understand feature relationships.
- Implementation of various machine learning classifiers.
- Nested cross-validation for model selection and performance evaluation.
