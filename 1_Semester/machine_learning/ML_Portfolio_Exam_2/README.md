# Data Science Coursework Projects

This repository contains two key projects from a Data Science coursework, each employing machine learning techniques for different analytical objectives.

## Project 1: Machine Learning Analysis

This project involves implementing and analyzing various machine learning algorithms. It includes several exercises each focusing on different aspects of machine learning, from k-Nearest Neighbors to Random Forest algorithms.

### Key Features
- In-depth analysis of k-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest algorithms.
- Exploration of the “Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention” dataset.
- Machine learning setup for feature selection and data splitting.
- Training and testing with different parametrizations of the Random Forest classifier.
- Evaluation and stability analysis, along with feature importance investigation.

### Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Plotly Express, Scikit-Learn.

## Project 2: Predictive Credit Compliance Analysis

The second project aims to predict credit compliance among bank customers. It uses machine learning techniques to determine whether specific features significantly influence credit compliance.

### Key Features
- Analyzing anonymized data of 1000 bank customers.
- Predicting customers' likelihood to fully pay back their credit or default.
- Machine learning models used: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier (SVC).
- Includes data ingestion, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning phases.
- Analysis of model performance using accuracy and balanced accuracy metrics.

### Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, Plotly Express, Scikit-Learn.
