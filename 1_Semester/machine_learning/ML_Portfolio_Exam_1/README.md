# Data Science Portfolio Exam - Machine Learning Analysis

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of various machine learning algorithms as part of a Data Science coursework project. The project is divided into several exercises, each focusing on different aspects of machine learning.

## Overview of Exercises

### Exercise 1: k-Nearest Neighbors Analysis
- Analysis of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with different parametrizations.
- Focus on the impact of number of neighbors, distance functions, and voting strategies on classifier accuracy.

### Exercise 2: Random Forest Algorithm Research
- Deep dive into the Random Forest algorithm, including its relation to Decision Trees.
- Comparison of Random Forests and Decision Trees in terms of goals, learning processes, feature selection, and more.
- Discussion on the parameters `n_estimators`, `criterion`, and `max_depth` in the context of sklearn's implementation.

### Exercise 3: Data Acquisition
- Utilization of the “Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention” dataset.
- Exploration of numerical and categorical features in the context of predicting user purchasing behavior.
- Analysis of class distribution and its implications for model performance.

### Exercise 4: Machine Learning Setup
- Preparation of a machine learning experiment with feature selection and data splitting.
- Development of a function to add configurations and results of experiments to a DataFrame.

### Exercise 5: Training and Testing
- Execution of experiments with different parametrizations of the Random Forest classifier.
- Evaluation of model performance across various combinations of the number of trees and maximum tree depth.

### Exercise 6: Evaluation and Stability Analysis
- Stability analysis of the Random Forest model.
- Creation and interpretation of performance diagrams.
- Discussion on additional factors influencing model evaluation.
